INFO 4240,Design Tech Social,"Spring, Summer",3,Information Science,"The social impact of technologies is typically thought about fairly late, if ever, in the design process. Indeed, it can be difficult at design time to predict what effects technologies will have. Nevertheless, design decisions can inadvertently ""lock in"" particular values early on. In this course, we will draw on science & technology studies, technology design, and the arts to analyze the values embodied in technology design and to design technologies to promote positive social impact. What social and cultural values do technology designs consciously or unconsciously promote? To what degree can social impact be ""built into"" a technology? How can we take social and cultural values into account in design?",,https://classes.cornell.edu/browse/roster/SP21/class/INFO/4240,
CS 1300,Design & Programming Web,Fall,3,Computer Science,"The World Wide Web is both a technology and a pervasive and powerful resource in our society and culture. To build functional and effective web sites, students need technical and design skills as well as analytical skills for understanding who is using the web, in what ways they are using it, and for what purposes. In this course, students develop skills in all three of these areas through the use of technologies such as XHTML, Cascading Stylesheets, and PHP. Students study how web sites are deployed and used, usability issues on the web, user-centered design, and methods for visual layout and information architecture. Through the web, this course provides an introduction to the interdisciplinary field of information science.",,https://classes.cornell.edu/browse/roster/FA20/class/CS/1300,

MAE 5340,Innovative Product Design,Fall,4,Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering,"Combined lecture and laboratory course on the new product development cycle: iterative design based on ethnographic fieldwork, team brainstorming, prototyping, testing, consumer feedback, and the limitations set by mass manufacturing of the final product. This course will instruct students on methods to identify product concepts based on machine designs with commercial potential. Design teams will perform market analysis and explore the IP space around their own ideas and rapidly iterate them into a final prototype via digital manufacturing (e.g., 3D CAD files manifested via robotic printing or machining); advanced instruction on these tools will be given to build prototypes, and quantitative marketing will be used as feedback from them. Early stage prototypes will progress into more sophisticated designs as the class progresses. Scale-up (cost, pricing, tooling) considerations for mass manufacturing of these products will be taken into account, as well as quantitative analysis of their machine designs for their expected utility.",,https://classes.cornell.edu/browse/roster/FA20/class/MAE/5340,
NBA 5180,Intro to Design and Innovation,"Fall, Spring",1.5,Management Business Admin,"This course introduces students to a design toolkit and mindset for creative problem solving. Embraced by major consulting firms, large corporations, tech start-ups and NGOs, design has rapidly emerged as an innovation driver. The design mindset enables a shift from a 20th century, market-based perspective to a more sustainable, human-centered approach to meet this century's systemic challenges. The course will introduce you to design strategy and provide you with the tools to apply it in a variety of settings, appropriate to careers in consulting, marketing, HR, new product development, financial services, digital tech, entrepreneurship and social innovation.
